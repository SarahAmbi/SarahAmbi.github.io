Hi everyone, my name is Sarah. I'm a informatics apprentice. Here I will tell my story and experience. First of all I will tell my idea of this site.
In the first place I did it to increase my knowledge of building a website and in the same time I wanna share my knowledge. If I wanna be true I need to tell you that I didn't know from beginning that I wanna be a application developer.
Here is a story I wanna tell you. During the apprenticeship application I had sometimes hard time. I send over twenty application. I know what you are think there are a lots of people who send more than I did. But I had hard critics that made my mood down.
Everytimes it remembers
